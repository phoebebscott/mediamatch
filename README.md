#Welcome to MediaMatch

This app was build with Ruby on Rails

It incorporates some cool gems and external technologies:

- facebook oauth
- httparty
- the Rotten Tomatoes API

After you sign in with your Facebook credentials, you can search for any movie that's in the Rotten Tomatoes database.

Once you find a movie, you can rate it in one of three ways:

- Laud it if you love it
- Bomb it if you hate it
- Bookmark it if you haven't seen it yet but want to

We are working on some exciting updates. Soon you will be able to filter movies by genre and other categories and find new stuff to watch. So stay tuned and come back for more!
